## Bluetooth pairing

Keep the MODE button (4) pressed for approximately 2 seconds until the LED MODE INDICATOR (8) starts flashing quickly in blue while your *Energy Music Box 7* is on. At this point, your speaker and your smartphone or tablet can be paired.

Once "Energy Music Box 7" appears on your device screen, press "connect". The devices will be connected immediately and without codes. You will hear a sound that confirms that both devices have been paired correctly. Your *Energy Music Box 7* will be automatically paired when you turn it on once again, provided that the Bluetooth connection of your smartphone or tablet is enabled.

To pair the speaker with the last device once again, you only need to turn on the *Energy Music 7* and the synchronization will start automatically.

If you want to synchronize another Bluetooth® device, press and hold the BLUETOOTH SEARCH (4) button. Doing so, the current synchronization will stop and the speaker will restart a new search of Bluetooth® devices.

*Note:* Your Energy Music Box 5 will automatically turn off after 10 minutes if it is in Bluetooth mode and not synchronized with any device.
