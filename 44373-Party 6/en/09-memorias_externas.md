## Removable USB units 

Your *Energy Party 6* allows you to play .mp3 and .wav files from USB sticks up to 64 GB.

Connect the USB stick into the *USB port to transfer data (26)* and your *Energy Party 6* will switch automatically to USB mode to play the USB contents.

If you turn off the *Energy Party 6* or remove any storage unit, the internal memory will save the moment when you paused playback. If you connect the same removable storage unit once again, playback will resume from the point at which it stopped.

To browse songs, press *Next (20)* and *Back (21)* on the display or the same buttons, *(38)* and *(46)*, on the remote control. To move to the next or the previous track, press and hold *Next (20)* and *Back (21)* on the display or the same buttons, *(38)* and *(19)*, on the remote control for 4 seconds.

Press *Adjust + FM frequency/ Next folder (USB)* or *Adjust + FM frequency/ Previous folder (USB)*, *(19)* and *(23)* on the device top display or *(37)* and *(39)* on the remote control to change folder.

### USB playback mode

Press *Playback mode (USB)/ restart (Bluetooth) (7)* to select between these 5 options:

1) **ALL:** all USB contents will be repeated. 

Folders and songs of removable storage units will be read in alphabetical order.

The songs saved in the root folder of the storage unit will be read first and in alphabetical order. The songs saved in folders will be read afterwards. Folders will be read in chronological order. When reading a folder, the same process starts once again and songs are read in alphabetical order.

   Here you have a diagram of the reading order:

2) **FOLDER:** the folder with the songs you are listening to will be repeated over and over again.

4) **RANDOM:** random playback of all the contents of your removable storage unit.

5) **OFF:** playback of all contents of the storage unit in the same order as in ALL mode but without repeating tracks.
