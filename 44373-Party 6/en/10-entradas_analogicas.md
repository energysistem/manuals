## Mini jack and RCA inputs (analogue inputs)

Your *Energy Party 6* features two analogue stereo inputs to connect external devices. The first one is a *Mini jack audio-in (10)* where you can connect the mini jack cable that comes with the product and the other one is a *RCA input (stereo input) (29)*. 

#### Mini jack input
Once you connect the cable to this input, "Line-in" mode will be enabled automatically and you will see the word "AUX 2" on the *Display (14)*. You will be able to change playback mode even if the cable is still connected.

To start, pause or resume playback press *Play and pause/ Tune in (22)* on the device top display or the same button,*(45)*, on the remote control.
We recommend to use this input to connect small devices such as mp3 players or smartphones. 

#### RCA input
This audio-in is situated on the rear top part with the name "INPUT". It has been conceived to connect your TV or audio devices permanently. 

When using the RCA input, the "RCA" mode will not be enabled automatically. Press *Line-in function (mini jack/ RCA)* (5) on the device top display or *Change function* (36) on the remote control until the word "AUX 1" appears on the *Display* (14) to enable it manually.

We recommend to use this input to connect audio systems such as stack systems, televisions or mixing desks permanently. 

**Important:** In both cases, you will have to control music playback (volume, equalizer or track changes) from the external device that you connect to your *Energy Party 6*.
