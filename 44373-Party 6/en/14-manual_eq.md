## Equalizer (EQ)

Your *Energy Party 6* offers two equalizer modes to adjust sound the way that you prefer:

### Equalizer with presets
Press the *Digital equalizer with presets* button (2) to choose between the following 6 digital equalizer modes with presets:
- FLAT (flat response)
- CLASSIC
- VOCAL
- POP
- ROCK
- JAZZ

### Manual equalizer
You can also use the 5-band analogue equalizer to customize sound manually. Press the Enable manual equalizer button (8) to enable this option and use afterwards the 5 sound equalizer controllers (manual EQ) (25) to manually adjust each frequency band.

#### Manual EQ with two Energy Party 6
As mentioned in the **Analogue outputs** section, you can connect two *Energy Party 6* using a "RCA to RCA" cable to play music on both devices simultaneously.

We recommend that you set the sliders of the *Sound equalizer controller (manual EQ)* (25) on the second speaker in the middle and adjust sound with the *Sound equalizer controller (manual EQ)* (25) on the main speaker. To do so, move down the 10 KHz band slider 2 points and the 3 KHz band slider one point. Keep the sliders of all other bands in the middle.
