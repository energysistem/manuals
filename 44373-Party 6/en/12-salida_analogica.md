## RCA audio-out (analogue output)

Your *Energy Party 6* features a *RCA output (stereo output) (30)* which allows you to connect other speakers that have an analogue input in order to hear your music simultaneously through several speakers.

It is also possible to connect a second *Energy Party 6*. To do so, connect one end of an RCA to RCA cable to the main speaker *RCA output (stereo output)* (30) and the other end to the second speaker *RCA input (stereo input)* (29). Music will be transferred to the second speaker and both devices will start playing music simultaneously, regardless of the playback mode of the main speaker. We recommend to adjust sound with the *Sound equalizer controller (manual EQ)* (25) of the main speaker to get a balanced sound. For more information on sound equalization see the **Equalizer** section of this manual.
