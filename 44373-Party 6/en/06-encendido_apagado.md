### Switching on and off the device

Once the *Energy Party 6* has been plugged into a socket, turn it on by moving the *Power switch* (27) to the "ON" position. From that moment on, you can turn it on or off by pressing the *On/ Off* button (16) on the device top display or the same button (35) on the remote control.

If you are not going to use the speaker for a long period of time, we recommend to move the *Power switch* (27) to the "OFF" position. 

**Important:** Your *Energy Party 6* features Auto Power-Off. This means that the device turns off automatically after 15 minutes, provided that it is on and is not playing music.

## Playback settings

You will find the playback mode buttons (USB, Bluetooth, AUX and FM Radio) on the upper part of the top display. You will see the selected function on the *Display* (14). You will be able to change function by pressing the *Change function* button (36) on the remote control.
