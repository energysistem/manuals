## FM radio

To use this function, you have to tune in to the available radio stations first. To do so, connect the radio antenna on the rear part of the top display and press and hold *Play and pause/ Tune in (22)* on the top display or the very same button on the remote control, *(45)*, for two seconds while radio mode is enabled. The process may take a few minutes. The radio stations will be saved to the memory of your *Energy Party 6*, therefore it is not necessary to carry out a new search each time you switch it on. You will only have to carry out a new search if you place the device in a new location or if you change the frequency of the saved radio station.

Once you have carried out a search of all radio stations available, press once again *Play and pause/ Tune in (22)* on the device top display or the same button on the remote control, *(45)*, to choose the radio station that you prefer. Press briefly this button to switch from one saved station to another.

To improve radio signal connect the speaker to the radio socket on the wall of your house using an IEC male to female cable. Both antenna cables have to be connected to the *FM Radio connection* (34) on the back of your *Energy Party 6*. We recommend to tune in to the radio stations using one of these options. This way, you will get a stronger signal.
