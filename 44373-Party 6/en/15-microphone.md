## Microphone

Your *Energy Party 6* features a *Jack audio-in for microphone* (33) to connect the provided microphone. This option may be used while using any mode. The microphone has a switch to turn it on and off.

You can modify the microphone strength using the *Microphone volume* (12) button and applying the *Microphone echo effect* (17). Both controllers are on the device top display.


## Audio-in for guitar

You will be able to use this input while playing content in playback mode or while playing the guitar only, as when using the *Jack audio-in for microphone* (33). We recommend that you turn down the *Guitar volume (jack audio-in)* (31) to the lowest level before connecting your guitar. You may select the volume that you prefer from that moment on.

**Important:** We recommend to turn down the volume to the lowest level first and select the volume that you like after connecting the guitar since extremely high volume may damage your *Energy Party 6*.
