## <quick_guide> Power/First use

Your Energy Smartphone has a rechargeable lithium ion battery that you must insert into the device. Open the  battery cover, insert the SIM cards, the microSD card (not included) and the battery. Place the battery cover onto the back of the phone. Initially the battery is charged at the factory, but it is highly recommended that you perform a full charge before the first use.
Recharge the battery by connecting the device to the power point only using the AC/DC 5V included with the product. The charging time ranges from 2-4 hours, depending on whether the device is off or running. In order to keep the battery in good condition, we recommend that you turn it off while charging and not leave it charging more than 8 hours.
You have several ways to improve the performance and optimize the battery use of your Energy Phone:
Set your Smartphone to automatically turn off the display after a few seconds of inactivity in Settings > Display > Sleep after.
Select an ideal display brightness in Settings > Display > Brightness.
Turn on the Wi-Fi connnection whenever you can since it needs less battery than 3G connection and you will save in your data connection.
