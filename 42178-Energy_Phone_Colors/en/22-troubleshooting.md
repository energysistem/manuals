## Troubleshooting

1.	Why can't I play some MP3 files?
The MP3 file must follow the "layer 3" standard for MPEG1, MPEG2 and MPEG 2.5 formats. Otherwise, it must be converted using a specific software.

2.	My Energy Phone does not turn on - what can I do?
Make sure that the battery is charged enough to power the device. If problem continues after leaving the device charging for at least 30 minutes, there may be a problem with the installed operating system. Please, refer to the "Updating" section of this manual.

3.	Why can't I play some WMA files?
Make sure you are not trying to play WMA file with DRM.

4.	Why can't I see my video, image or text files when using the music player?
Generally, applications only display the files supported by the program. Therefore, while you browse the folders using a specific application, you can only see the files associated to that program (songs in the music player, videos in the movie player, etc).  In order to see all the files stored in the internal memory, start the FileXplorer application from the application menu.

5.	Which video formats are compatible with my Energy Phone?
Your Energy Phone can play multiple video formats wihtout recoding, such as MP4, 3GP, MOV and more.

6.	Why can't I display my .jpg images?
Many digital cameras and image editing software add hidden data to .jpg files. This can prevent your Energy Phone from loading the images. Try to delete them and save the image with another name.

7.	Sometimes the screen turns black and the device does not respond.
It is always better to reboot the device through one of the options available within the system, but if that is not possible, remove the battery, put it back again and press the power button.

8.	The built-in memory of the Energy Phone Colors has 4GB, but the available memory is lower. Why?
The Android#trade# operating system and the preinstalled applications need approximately 1.5GB to work. Therefore, the available memory for additional data is less than 4GB.

9.	What must I do to install an application?
First, make sure that the file has the Android#trade# application extension (.APK). Android#trade# will ask you to activate the app installation from "Unknown sources"(this option is disabled for safety). To authorize the installation of apps, you only have to follow the instructions on the screen the first time you try to install an application:  Settings / Security / Unknown sources (activate).

10.	How long does the battery last?
It depends largely on the use, the screen brightness, the use of headphones or speakers, the Wi-Fi connection and the use of GSM and 3G networks. The Energy Phone Colors battery lasts up to 150 hours on standby and 10 hours talking.
