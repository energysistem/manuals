## Bluetooth pairing

Turn off your Energy Earphones Sport 3 Bluetooth and press *PLAY/ PAUSE* (1) for approximately 4 seconds, until the *LED INDICATOR* (4) starts flashing red and blue. At this point, you will be able to pair your earphones with your smartphone or tablet. Once your Energy Sport earphones have been detected, press "connect". The devices will be connected immediately and without codes. You will hear a sound that confirms that both devices have been paired correctly.
