## Radio FM Function

Before using radio you have to search radio stations first. The device will save them in memory to select them later. It is not necessary to repeat this search unless change of location or the modification of the radio station signal.

Search radio stations by pressing the MODE button (1) during 2 seconds. The device will make a radio stations search and will save the radio stations found in the device internal memory. This process may take a few minutes.

In order to select among different stations, you have just to press NEXT (3) or PREVIOUS (7) buttons. Stations will appear at the same order as they were saved.
