## Removable USB sticks and microSD cards

Your *Energy Tower 8 g2* allows you to play .mp3 and .wav files from USB sticks and microSD cards (up to 128 GB).

Connect the USB stick into the corresponding port or insert the microSD card into the corresponding slot. Your *Energy Tower 8 g2* will switch automatically to USB or microSD mode to play the content of the inserted storage card or USB stick.

Bear in mind that you will be able to switch the playback mode by pressing the *Change mode (2) or (11)* button. 

If you turn off the *Energy Tower 8 g2* or remove any storage card or USB stick, the internal memory will save the moment when you paused playback. If you insert the same removable card or stick once again, playback will resume from the point at which it stopped.

To browse songs, press the *Next (3)* and *Back (9)* buttons on the display or the same buttons *(13) and (19)* on the remote control. To move to the next or the previous track, press and hold the *Next (3)* and *Back (9)* buttons on the display or the same buttons *(13) and (19)* on the remote control.
You will be able to browse through another folder by pressing the *Change folder (17)* button on the remote control.

## Playback mode

Press the *Change repeat mode (15)* button to select between these 4 options:

1) **ALL:** All card or stick contents will be repeated. 

The folders of your external cards or sticks will be read in chronological order and the songs included in your folders will be read in alphabetical order.

If, for instance, you copy two music folders to an external card or stick, namely "A" and "B", and you first copy folder "B" and then folder "A", your device will play the first song in alphabetical order contained in folder "B" in the first place. 

   Here you have a diagram of the reading order:

2) **FOLDER:** The folder with the songs you are listening to will be repeated.

4) **RANDOM:** Random playback of all the contents of your removable card or stick.
