## Troubleshooting

* Does this Keyboard work with all the devices?

No. This Keyboard was designed exclusively to work with Energy Tablet Pro 9  Windows 3G.

* The keyboard and my device have been paired rightly, but the symbols printed on the keyboard don’t match with the ones shown on the device.

It is possible that your keyboard has not been configured to use Spanish language. Please confirm that your devices are configured selecting Spanish language (it is not necessary to change the OSD language).
