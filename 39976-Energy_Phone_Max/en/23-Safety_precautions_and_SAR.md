## Safety precautions and SAR

### Safety precautions
It is prohibited to use the phone in certain places or situations, such as airplanes, hospitals, service stations and garages.
To reduce the amount of radiation, use a hands-free kit, the speaker mode, a
bluetooth headset and do not make calls in places where the signal is weak, in the car, train or subway. Keep the phone away from sensitive areas, like the belly of pregnant women, especially when making a phone call. If you have an electronic implant (pacemakers, insulin pumps, neurostimulators...) place the phone at least 15 cm from the body and on the opposite side to the implant when making a phone call.

### Exposure information (SAR)

This device meets the guidelines developed by the ICNIRP for exposure to radio waves. The unit does not exceed the SAR radio wave exposure limits. This unit measures the amount of radio energy absorbed by the body when using a device. The SAR limit adopted by Europe is 2.0 W/kg averaged over 10 grams of tissue. The test performed showed that the highest SAR value for this device when using it near the ear/head is 0.578 W/Kg.
