## Battery Management/First use

Your Energy eReader Pro has a rechargeable lithium battery. Initially the battery is charged at the factory, but it is highly recommended that you perform a full charge before the first use. Recharge the battery by connecting the device to the outlet through a USB charger (5V / 1Ah max.) or to your computer using the microUSB cable included with the product. The charging time ranges between 3-5 hours, depending on if the device is turned off or running. In order to keep the battery in good condition, we recommend that you turn it off while charging and not leave it charging more than 8 hours.
