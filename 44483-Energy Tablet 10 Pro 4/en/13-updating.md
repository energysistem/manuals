## Updates

Your Energy Tablet 8" Max 3 has an Android based operating system that can be reinstalled or updated if necessary. Updates will be carried out via OTA (Over-The-Air) by default, so your tablet will automatically connect to our servers, will download the update and will install it as soon as it is available.

You can also update your tablet using your PC. The process is simple but has to be done carefully and only when is really necessary. If the device does not respond, restarts unexpectedly or you experience problems accessing the content stored on the built-in memory, you should reinstall or update the operating system to the latest compatible version available.

Please follow these steps to install it:

1. Make sure that the battery of your tablet has at least a 60% charge. If this is not the case, plug it to the external power source using the provided power adapter.

2. Access www.energysistem.com/en from your computer.

3. Access the *Support* section and choose *Tablet* from the product range list.

4. Choose your Energy Tablet model from the dropdown list that appears and then download the latest firmware version available.
**Important:**
Please make sure the firmware version you are downloading is intended for your model and serial number.

5. Unzip the file on your computer.

6. Open the text file that you will find in the folder and follow the instructions to install the firmware.
