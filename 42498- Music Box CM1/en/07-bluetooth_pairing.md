## Bluetooth Pairing

Every time you turn on your *Energy Music Box CM1 Bluetooth*, pairing mode will start automatically; at the same time, the search and pairing process will start on your Bluetooth® device (smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc).  Once you have identified the *Energy Music Box CM1 Bluetooth* on your device, select connect. It will immediately connect without codes. The speaker will play a sound indicating that the connection has been established.

To pair the speaker with the last device again, you only need to turn on the Energy Music Box CM1 Bluetooth and the synchronization will start automatically.

If you want to pair another Bluetooth® device, you should press the FOLDER CHANGE (5) button. That way the current pairing will end and it will start searching for other Bluetooth® devices.
