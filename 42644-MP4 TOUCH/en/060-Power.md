## Turning on/off the device and charging the battery

Turn on and off your *Energy MP4* Touch by moving the *On/Off/Lock (4)* switch upwards and keeping the position for 2 seconds. To lock/unlock the device, move the *On/Off/Lock switch (4)* to the corresponding up/down position.
Connect the microUSB cable to the USB port (11) and proceed to connect the other end of the cable to a computer or any other device with USB port to charge the battery.

Your Energy MP4 has a rechargeable lithium battery. To enhance battery life, please charge the battery completely before using the device for the first time. In order to charge the battery, connect your music player to your computer USB port.

The charging time ranges from 2 to 3 hours, depending on whether the music player is on or off. In order to keep the battery in perfect condition, we recommend to switch it off or not to use the device while charging the battery. Please do not leave the device charging for more than 8 hours.

Your Energy MP4 can extend the battery life in two different ways: the display turns off after a few seconds of inactivity or turns off completely after a few minutes of inactivity. You can adjust the time of both functions if you go to *'SETTINGS -> Screen settings"* or *"SETTINGS -> Auto shutdown -> Standby"*. In order to unlock the screen, move briefly the *On/Off/Lock switch (4)* upwards.
To extend the battery life of your device, we recommend not to disable these power saving systems completely.


**Note 1:** We recommend not to store or leave your device unused for long periods of time with an empty battery.

**Note 2:** If your *Energy MP4* Touch does not react or if your computer does not recognize the device, you can always restart the system inserting a sharp pointed object into the microphone connection.
