## Audio input

If you don't want to use the Bluetooth connection, you can also connect your *Energy Headphones 7 Bluetooth ANC* to your music player using the audio cable provided. You don't need to switch on your headphones if you want to use the audio cable. In order for your headphones to work properly, do not let the battery run down completely.

Simply connect the cable provided to the AUDIO INPUT (8) to enable this mode.

**Important:** *You will not be able to control playback from the headphones while this mode is on so you will have to adjust the volume and switch to the previous/next song from your music player*.
