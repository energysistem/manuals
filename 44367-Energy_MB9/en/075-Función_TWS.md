### TWS (True Wireless Stereo) function

This option enables to connect another Energy Music Box 9 wirelessly within a distance range of 10 m to hear music with twice as much power and to create a stereo sound system made up of two different channels: left and right. 

Switch on your two Energy Music Box 9, press the TWS button (13) of each speaker and they will be paired automatically. From that moment on, they will play the same content simultaneously. Press the TWS button (13) of each speaker once again to select the channel for each of them. Press and hold once again the TWS button (13) of the secondary speaker for a few seconds to disable and enable TWS connection.

Use the master speaker to control playback functions while True Wireless mode is enabled.  The secondary speaker will only allow to adjust the volume. If you adjust any of the functions, the changes will always apply to both speakers. This means that if you turn up the volume through any of the speakers, you will be turning up the volume of both of them.
