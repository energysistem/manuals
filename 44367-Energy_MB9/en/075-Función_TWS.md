## TWS (True Wireless Stereo) function

This option enables to connect another *Energy Music Box 9* wirelessly within a distance range of 10 m to hear music with twice as much power and to create a stereo sound system made up of two different channels: left and right. 

Switch on both *Energy Music Box 9* and select Bluetooth mode, press the *TWS connection* button (13) of each speaker and you will see that the *TWS indicators* start blinking. Once both devices have been connected correctly, you will hear another confirmation sound and the *TWS indicators* will stop blinking. From that moment on, they will play the same content simultaneously. Press once again the *TWS connection* button (13) of each speaker to select the channel. Press and hold once again the *TWS connection* button (13) of the secondary speaker for a few seconds to disable TWS connection.

Use the master speaker to control playback functions while True Wireless mode is enabled.  The secondary speaker will only allow you to adjust the volume. If you adjust any of the functions, the changes will always apply to both speakers. This means that if you turn up the volume of any of the speakers, you will be turning up the volume of both of them.

**Important:** In order to set up channels and disable the TWS connection, you have to press the *TWS connection* button (13) of the speaker that shows that the *Bluetooth Function Indicator* (15) is on.
