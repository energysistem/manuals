## Bluetooth pairing

Use the *Change function* button (14) to select the Bluetooth mode while your *Energy Music Box 9* is on. Once you have done this, press and hold the same button for 2 seconds until the "BT" LED *function indicator* (15) starts flashing. At this point, your speaker and your smartphone or tablet can be paired.

Once "Energy Music Box 9" appears on your device screen, press "connect". The devices will be connected immediately and without codes.  You will hear a confirmation sound when both devices are synchronized and the "BT" LED *function indicator* (15) will stop flashing and will glow as usual. Your *Energy Music Box 9* will be automatically paired when you turn it on once again, provided that the Bluetooth connection of your smartphone or tablet is enabled.

Press and hold the *Change function* (14) button until the "BT" LED *function indicator* (15) starts flashing in order to pair another device. You will also hear a confirmation sound. By doing so, the current synchronization will stop and the speaker will start a new search of BluetoothÂ® devices.

**Important:** Your *Energy Music Box 9* will automatically turn off after 5 minutes if it is in Bluetooth mode and not synchronized with any device.
