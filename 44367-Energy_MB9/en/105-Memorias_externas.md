## External storage

Insert an USB unit or a microSD card into the corresponding slots, (9) and (10), to play MP3 or WAV files. Your *Energy Music Box 9* will switch to that playback mode automatically. Music playback will start in a few seconds once the external storage unit has been read. Do not remove the storage unit while the reading process is in progress.

If you turn off the *Energy Music Box 9* while the device is playing the files of the external storage unit, the internal memory will save the moment when you paused playback. If you insert the same removable card or stick once again, playback will resume from the point at which it stopped.

To move to the previous or the following track, press *Next (6)* or *Back (4)*.  

Press and hold *Next (6)* or *Back (4)* while the device is playing a song to fast forward through it or to rewind it. Playback will resume when you release the button.

**Important:** We recommend not to remove the external storage unit while the reading process is in progress. Before doing that, please change mode or turn off the speaker.
