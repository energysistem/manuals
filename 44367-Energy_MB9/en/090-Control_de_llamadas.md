## Call control

Synchronizing your *Energy Music Box 9* with your smartphone allows you to control your calls from the speaker.

When receiving a call, the song you are listening to will stop and the ringing tone will sound instead. Press the *Play/ Pause and Call control* button (5) to answer an incoming call and press it once again to hang up. The song will automatically resume afterwards.

Press and hold the *Play/ Pause and Call control* button (5) when receiving an incoming call to reject it. Press and hold the *Play/ Pause and Call control* button (5) while Bluetooth mode is enabled to redial telephone numbers.

If you receive an incoming call while TWS function is enabled, playback will pause and you will only be able to hear the voice of the person who calls through the master speaker.
