## Playback control

Once your *Energy Music Box 9* is synchronized, you can control the volume from the speaker itself. To do so, press *Volume + (3)* or *Volume - (2)*. You will hear a warning sound when reaching the maximum and minimum volume levels.

To start, pause or resume playback, press the *Play/ Pause an Call control* button (5).

To move to the previous or the following track, press *Next (6)* or *Back (6)*. 

**Important:** Bear in mind that you will only be able to control playback from the music player while the speaker is in AUX mode.
