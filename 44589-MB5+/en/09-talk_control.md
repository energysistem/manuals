## Call control

Synchronizing your *Energy Music Box 5* with your smartphone allows you to control your calls from the speaker.

When receiving a call, the track you are listening to will stop and the ringing tone will sound instead. In order to answer an incoming call you will only have to press the CALL CONTROL (5) button, and press it again to hang up. The track will automatically resume afterwards.
