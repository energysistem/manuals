## Audio input

You can also enjoy your *Energy Music Box 5* without synchronizing it with a Bluetooth device thanks to its AUDIO-IN (11) ) that will allow you to connect your music player using an audio cable with 3.5 mm jack connector.

**NOTE:** It is not possible to control music playback from the speaker while you are using it in this mode. In order to control these functions you will have to use the music player that you have connected.
