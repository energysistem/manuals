## Troubleshooting

1.	Why can't I play some MP3 files?
The MP3 file must follow the "layer 3" standard for MPEG1, MPEG2 and MPEG 2.5 formats. Otherwise, it must be converted using a specific software.
2.	My Energy Phone does not turn on, what can I do?
Make sure that the battery is charged enough to power the device. If after leaving the device charging for at least 30 minutes the problem continues, there may be a problem with the installed operating system. Please, refer to the "Updating" section of this manual.
3.	Why can't I play some WMA files?
Make sure you are not trying to play WMA file with DRM (Digital Rights Management).
4.	Why can't I see my video, image or text files when using the music player?
Generally, applications only display the files supported by the program. Therefore, while you browse the folders using a specific application, you can only see the files associated to that program (songs in the music player, videos in the movie player, etc). In order to see all the files stored in the internal memory, start the FileXplorer application from the application menu.
5.	Which video formats are compatible with my Energy Phone?
Your Energy Phone can play multiple video formats wihtout recoding, such as MP4, 3GP, MOV and more.
6.	Why can't I display my .jpg images?
Many digital cameras and image editing software add hidden data to .jpg files. This can prevent your Energy Phone from loading the images. Try to delete them and save the image with another name.
7.	Sometimes the screen turns black and the device does not respond.
It is always better to reboot the device through one of the options available within the system, but if that is not possible, reboot it by extracting and inserting again the battery.
8.	The built-in memory of the Energy Phone Neo Lite is 4 GB, but the available memory is lower. Why?
The Android#trade# operating system and the preinstalled applications need approximately 2,2 GB to work. Therefore, the available memory for additional data is less than 4 GB.
9.	What must I do to install an application?
First, make sure that the file has the Android#trade# application extension (.APK).Android#trade# will ask you to activate the application installation from "Unknown sources", this option is disabled for safety. To authorize the installation of applications, you only have to follow the instructions on the screen the first time you try to install an application: Settings / Security / Unknown sources (activate).
10.	How long does the battery last? 
It depends largely on the usage conditions, such as the screen brightness, use of headphones or speaker, if the Wi-Fi connection is enabled or disabled and the use of GSM and 3G networks. The battery life of the Energy Phone Neo Lite lasts up to 120 hours on standby and 8 hours talk time.
11.	Which are the 3G operating frequencies of my device?
Your Energy Phone Neo Lite is prepared for the WCDMA 900/2100 MHz bands to work on 3G mode.
